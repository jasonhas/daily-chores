## First Things First

Welcome to my _new blog_ about my daily activity of starting up my own side business. The kids these days are calling it a "Side Hustle". As you read this, there is one thing I want you to keep in mind. These posts are 100% written by me, [Jason](/about/), not AI, not a ghost writer. This is my daily diary of my experiments to see if I can generate a successful side business.

## Why Am I Doing This?

I'll admit that I might watch a little too much YouTube. I'm guilty of waking up early in the morning and consuming an hour of video in the mornings. Most people enjoy a little reality TV at the end of the night, but I don't. My guilty pleasure is in the morning while I'm drinking my coffee and combing through my personal email.

For whatever reason, my feed is full of thumbnails that claim **"I make 5 figures selling T-Shirts"** or my favorite is **"30K a month off of Amazon Arbitrage"**. In my cynical mind, all those are ~~bullshit~~, err possibly made up. If they were making that kinda money, they surely don't want to share their secrets with you and me. They are making more money off of YouTube views and affiliate links than they are the products they are peddling on their channel. 

However, I don't fault these _gurus_. They are out there trying to make a buck, and for some of them it's very lucrative. That's not my goal. My goal is much simpler than that.

## My Goal

My goal is to see whether or not it's possible and worth the time and effort to try and run an online business. I also want to see if I can at the very least cover my expenses for everything. You'll be able to follow along in my [P&L section](/profitloss/). This is where you can find every penny spent and earned.

## Here Are My Rules

1. **Document Everything**: This is where everything will be listed. The equipment I bought, the expenses, the sales ( oh dear Lord let there be sales), and all the unexpected learnings along the way. 

2. **Daily Updates**: I truly believe that in order to be successful, hard work and dedication is the only way. A little luck wouldn't hurt, but in order to really give the maximum effort, I'll need to make some addition/change each day. The more content, the more opportunity I'll create.

3. **Zero Debt**: My idea is to make as much as possible with as little as possible. I'm not going to buy a bunch of things before I know I can actually make money with what I already have. To take it a bit further, I'm not going to start making stickers and then switch to making T-Shirts until I've paid off what I bought in sticker material. That kinda thing.

## This Site Is Constantly Under Development

You might be able to say that I'm doing all of this live. Meaning, I'm updating the site, adding content to this site as I go. You might see some pages in the navigation that don't work, or link to something in the footer that goes nowhere. That's because I haven't finished those parts of the site yet. 

I read a book called the "[Million Dollar Weekend](https://amzn.to/4efuZ5i)", and if I took anything from that book, it was simply to get started. Don't wait until everything is perfect, just get going. So that's what I'm doing, I'm going and I'll update and fix stuff along the way. So please excuse my mess as I get things in order.

## Let's get Moving

So that's where I'm at. Starting this blog (which I built by hand with [Astro](https://astro.build/)), is a great first start. Tomorrow we will get a bit further with building the business. After that, I don't have a clue. Like a true "Million Dollar Weekend" disciple, I'm just going to learn on the fly.
